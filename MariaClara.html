A lady who enjoyed excellent social standing in San Diego. Maria Clara and Ibarra are engaged to be married; they have known each other since they were young children, but Father Dámaso, her godfather, is not happy with this arrangement and tries to get in the way. Following Ibarra's excommunication for nearly murdering Dámaso at a dinner party, plans are made for Maria Clara to wed Linares, a young Spaniard. She keeps quiet about her opposition to this proposal because she doesn't want to offend her socialite father, Captain Tiago, who disavows Ibarra in order to maintain his good standing with friars like Father Dámaso. Maria Clara later learns that Father Dámaso, not Captain Tiago, was the one who had fathered her; her mother had passed away in childbirth. Father Salvi's false accusation of Ibarra as a subversive leads to his trial, and Mara Clara is coerced into giving the court letters Ibarra had sent to her that his prosecutors had wrongfully used as proof of misconduct. She conceals this information because she doesn't want to tarnish her mother's name or jeopardize Captain Tiago's reputation. Dámaso is her biological father. She still harbors a deep regret for betraying Ibarra. She calls off her marriage to Linares after the press ultimately publish a fake rumor of his passing and decides to join a convent instead since she cannot bear to live in a world without Ibarra.

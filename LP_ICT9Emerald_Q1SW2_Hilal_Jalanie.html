          <th>Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra y Magsalin</th>
          <td>a well-off young man of mixed Spanish and Filipino descent, who has just arrived in the Philippines from Europe after seven years of study abroad. Ibarra is well-educated and respected, but the friars in his native San Diego are wary of him. This is due to the fact that Don Rafael, his father, was recently jailed and designated a subversive and a heretic, a designation that ultimately resulted in his death in custody. On his first night back in the Philippines, Ibarra learns of this. Later, in an effort to fulfill his father's wishes, he makes the decision to establish a secular school in San Diego that is free from the influence of obsessive friars like Padre Dámaso and Padre Salv, Ibarra's two main rivals. <a href="B:\JR HILAL\Games\Sublime Text\Codes\CrisostomoIbarra.html">MORE INFORMATION</a></td>

          <td>a lady who enjoyed excellent social standing in San Diego. Mara Clara and Ibarra are childhood friends who have been engaged to be married. Padre Dámaso, who is her godfather, is not happy with this arrangement and tries to get in the way. Plans are made for Maria Clara to wed Linares, a young Spaniard following Ibarra's excommunication for nearly murdering Dámaso at a dinner party.  <a href="B:\JR HILAL\Games\Sublime Text\Codes\MariaClara.html">MORE INFORMATION</a></td>

          <th>Don Santiago De Los Santos (Kapitan Tiago)</th>
          <td>a well-liked and respected socialite from the rich class of the Philippines. Captain Tiago is one of the wealthiest landowners in Manila and San Diego and is close with prominent clergymen like Father Salv and Father Dámaso. One of the reasons he rapidly withdraws his support of Ibarra after the friars tarnish the young man's name is because he is worried about making sure his daughter, Mara Clara, marries a rich guy with plenty of social capital.

A well-off young man of mixed Spanish and Filipino descent, who has just arrived in the Philippines from Europe after seven years of study abroad. Ibarra is well-educated and respected, but the friars in his native San Diego are wary of him. This is due to the fact that Don Rafael, his father, was recently jailed and designated a subversive and a heretic, a designation that ultimately resulted in his death in custody. On his first night back in the Philippines, Ibarra learns of this. Later, in an effort to fulfill his father's wishes, he makes the decision to establish a secular school in San Diego that is free from the influence of obsessive friars like Father DÃ¡maso and Father Salvi, Ibarra's two major rivals. Unfortunately, Father Salvi collaborates with a number of Ibarra's adversaries to portray him as a government conspirator, forcing him to depart San Diego as an outlaw revolutionary. As a result, creating the school proves to be a challenging endeavor. This entails leaving behind Maria Clara, his true love and the woman he was initially intended to wed. Because Rizal employs Ibarra to express concepts about colonialism and the structure of power in the Philippines, Ibarra is a politically significant character. Ibarra maintains throughout the remainder of the book that despite their corruption, the Spanish government and the Catholic friars are an important source of support for the Philippines.

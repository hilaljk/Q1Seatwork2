A well-liked and respected socialite from the rich class of the Philippines. Captain Tiago is one of the wealthiest landowners in Manila and San Diego and is close with prominent clergymen like Father Salvi and Father Dámaso. One of the reasons he rapidly withdraws his support of Ibarra after the friars tarnish the young man's name is because he is worried about making sure his daughter, Mara Clara, marries a rich guy with plenty of social capital. As for Captain Tiago's personal shame, his wife had an affair with Father Dámaso before giving birth to Mara Clara, so he is not Mara Clara's real father. He may be so obsessed with upholding the impression of respectability since his own wife betrayed him. As a result, he is oblivious to the pretentious behavior of individuals like Doctor de Espadaa, a for-profit doctor, and his wife, Doa Victorina, a clear social climber. Captain Tiago is quick to agree when they suggest their nephew Linares as a potential new match for Mara Clara, believing that such a pairing will assure respectability.
